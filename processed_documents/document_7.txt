understood subject to the exceptions contained in the Chapter entitled 
“General Exceptions”, though those exceptions are not repeated in such 
definition, penal provision, or illustration.
Illustrations
(a) The sections, in this Code, which contain definitions of offences, do not 
express that a child under seven years of age can not commit such offences; 
but the definitions are to be understood subject to the general exception which
provides that nothing shall be an offence which is done by a child under seven 
years of age.
(b) A, a police officer, without warrant, apprehends Z, who has committed 
murder. Here A is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement for he was
bound by law to apprehend Z and therefore the case falls within the general 
exception which provides that “nothing is an offence which is done by a person
who is bound by law to do it”.
