operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is 
likely thereby to cause Z’s death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as
A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.
Section 38. Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences
Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a 
criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.
Illustration
A attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z 
would be only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will 
towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the 
provocation, assists A in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in 
causing Z’s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable 
homicide.
