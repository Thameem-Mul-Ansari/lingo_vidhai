Section 39. Voluntarily
A person is said to cause an effect “voluntarily” when he causes it by means 
whereby he intended to cause it, or by means which, at the time of employing 
those means, he knew or had reason to believe to be likely to cause it.
Illustration
A sets fire, by night, to an inhabited house in a large town, for the purpose of 
facilitating a robbery and thus causes the death of a person. Here, A may not 
have intended to cause death; and may even be sorry that death has been 
caused by his act; yet, if he knew that he was likely to cause death, he has 
caused death voluntarily.
