Section 34. Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention
134. Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.- When 
a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common 
intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner 
as if it were done by him alone.
Distinction between ’common intention’ and ‘common object’
A clear distinction is made out between common intention and common 
object is that common intention denotes action in concert and necessarily 
postulates the existence of a pre-arranged plan implying a prior meeting of the
minds, while common object does not necessarily require proof of prior 
meeting of minds or pre-concert. Though there is a substantial difference 
between the two sections namely 34 and 149, they also to some extent overlap 
and it is a question to be determined on the facts of each case; Chittarmal v.
